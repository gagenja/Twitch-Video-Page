# Twitch-Video-Page
A small web application using Twitch's video API. Consists of a video search/display page, as well as a details page for specific videos.
To run, extract contents to folder and open 'home.html' in Google Chrome or Internet Explorer. 
COMPATABILITY NOTE: Firefox and Mircosoft Edge cause graphical problems, because I used Flexbox to format my page. As far as I can tell, Firefox cannot support flexbox, and it sure looks like Edge doesn't either. Other browsers remain untested.
